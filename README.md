A script designed to display weather information on a [Pimoroni Four Letter
pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/four-letter-phat). It's reading data from my local mqtt server that's using specific topic names. I need to clean up that code and will link to that as well.

A mqtt.conf file must be created. It's a standard configparser doc that must define a MQTT server and it's port (default port is 1883).
